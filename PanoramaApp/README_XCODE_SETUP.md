# Xcode Project Setup Guide

To complete the integration of MyPanorama_Full functionality, you need to add the following files to your Xcode project:

## Files to Add

1. **TextFieldViewlet.swift**
2. **FormExampleViewlet.swift**
3. **NoteCardViewlet.swift**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open PanoramaApp.xcodeproj in Xcode**

2. **Add the missing viewlet files:**
   - In the project navigator, right-click on the "Shared" folder
   - Select "Add Files to PanoramaApp..."
   - Navigate to `/PanoramaApp/Shared/`
   - Select these three files:
     - `TextFieldViewlet.swift`
     - `FormExampleViewlet.swift`
     - `NoteCardViewlet.swift`
   - Important: Make sure both targets are checked:
     - ✅ PanoramaApp (iOS)
     - ✅ PanoramaApp (macOS)
   - Click "Add"

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Select your target platform (iOS or macOS)
   - Build the project (⌘B)
   - Run the app (⌘R)

## What You'll See

Once the files are added and the app is running, you'll see:

1. **Grid Background** - Visual grid lines for alignment
2. **Form Example** (top left) - A working form with text fields
3. **Panorama Examples** (top right) - Title and feature list
4. **Note Cards** (bottom) - Four draggable note cards with different colors:
   - Yellow: "Todo List"
   - Blue: "Meeting Notes"
   - Green: "Ideas"
   - Pink/Magenta: "Shopping List"
5. **Legacy Viewlets** (bottom right) - Original circular viewlets with button

## Features

- **Text Input**: Click on any text field to type
- **Draggable Cards**: Click and drag note cards to move them
- **Delete Cards**: Click the × button to remove a card
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both iOS and macOS

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:

1. **Clean the build folder**: Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
2. **Check target membership**: Select each file and ensure both iOS and macOS targets are checked in the File Inspector
3. **Verify imports**: Make sure the files import `Panorama` framework correctly

## Note

The MyPanorama.swift file has already been updated with the full functionality. Once you add the three viewlet files to the Xcode project, everything will work together seamlessly.
